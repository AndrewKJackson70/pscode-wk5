// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

sum = int1 + int2

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if 
input1/2 = int 
	then
print "The number is even"
if else
	then
print "The number is odd"


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

dataset = (input1, input2, input3, input4, input5)
	then define
mean(dataset) = PromptB
	then define
min(dataset) = PromptC
	then define
max(dataset) = PromptC2
	then
Print "The mean is (PromptB), the smallest number is (PromptC) and the largest number is (PromptC2)"
